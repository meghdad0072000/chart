You may specify Charting library widget parameters when calling its constructor. E.g., your call may look like

```javascript
new TradingView.widget({
    symbol: 'A',
    interval: 'D',
    timezone: "America/New_York",
    container_id: "tv_chart_container",
    locale: "ru",
    datafeed: new Datafeeds.UDFCompatibleDatafeed("https://demo_feed.tradingview.com")
});
```

Find full supported parameters list below. Please remember that changing those parameters after chart is initialized **does not work**. If you want to change the state of a chart after it was initialized, use [[Widget methods|Widget-Methods]] instead.

Properties marked :chart: are available in [[Trading Terminal]] only.

#### symbol, interval [mandatory]
Initial symbol & interval of your chart. Format of `interval` is described in another [[article|Resolution]].

#### timeframe
Sets initial timeframe for the chart. Timeframe is period of bars that will be loaded and shown on a screen.
Valid timeframe is a number with letter D for days and M for months.

#### container_id [mandatory]
`id` attribute of a DOM element you want to contain the widget.

#### datafeed [mandatory]
JavaScript object implementing appropriate interface ([[JS API|JS-Api]]) to feed the chart width data.

#### timezone
Initial timezone of the chart. Numbers on time scale depend on this timezone.
See [[supported timezones list|Symbology#timezone]] for available values. Set it to `exchange` to use the exchange timezone. For overriding default value you should use [[overrides|Widget-Constructor#overrides]] section

#### debug
Setting this property to `true` makes the chart to write detailed API logs to console. Feature `charting_library_debug_mode` is a synonym for this field usage.

#### library_path
A path to `static` folder

#### width, height
The desired size of a widget. Please make sure the widget has enough space to look smart.

**Remark**: if you want the chart to occupy all the available space, do not use '100%' in those field. Use `fullscreen` parameter instead (see below). It's because of issues with DOM nodes resizing in different browsers.

#### fullscreen <false>
Boolean value showing whether chart should occupy all the available space in the window.

#### autosize <false>
Boolean value showing whether chart should occupy all the available space in the container and resize with it is resized. This parameter is introduced in version 1.3.

#### symbol_search_request_delay

#### auto_save_delay
Delay in seconds to wait before onAutoSaveNeeded can be called again.
This parameter is introduced in version 1.5.

#### toolbar_bg
Toolbars background color

#### study_count_limit
**Since 1.5 version.**

Maximum amount of studies on a chart or multichart layout. Minimum value is 2.

#### studies_access
*version: 1.1*

            name: "<study name>",
            grayed: true
        },
        < ... >
    ]
}
```
* `type` is a type of list. Supported values: `black` (all the listed items should be disabled), `white` (only the listed items should be enabled).
* `tools` is an array of objects. Each object could have following properties:
  * `name` (mandatory) is the name of a study. Use the same names as you can see them in Indicators widget
  * `grayed` is a boolean showing whether this study should be visible but look like it's disabled. If the study is grayed and user clicks it, then `onGrayedObjectClicked` is called.

#### drawings_access
*version: 1.1*
This property has the same structure as the `studies_access` described above. Use the same names as you see them in UI.
**Remark**: There is a special case for font-based drawings. Use "Font Icons" name for them. This group is a special case and its drawings cannot be enabled or disabled particularly -- one can either enable or disable the whole group.

#### saved_data
JS object containing saved chart content (JSON, see save/load calls below). Use this parameter if you already have chart's JSON when creating chart. If you want to load chart content to chart that is already initialized then use `loadData()` widget method.

#### locale

2. dateFormatter

You can use these formatters to customize displaying of date and time values.
Both values are objects with functions `format` and `formatLocal`:

```javascript
function format(date)
function formatLocal(date)
```

These functions should return text representing date or time. `formatLocal` should convert date and time to local timezone.

Example:

```javascript
customFormatters: {
  timeFormatter: {
    format: function(date) { var _format_str = '%h:%m'; return _format_str.replace('%h', date.getUTCHours(), 2). replace('%m', date.getUTCMinutes(), 2). replace('%s', date.getUTCSeconds(), 2); }
  },
  dateFormatter: {
    format: function(date) { return date.getUTCFullYear() + '/' + date.getUTCMonth() + '/' + date.getUTCDate(); }
  }
}
```

You can override most of Charting Library properties (which also may be edited by user through UI) using `overrides` parameter of Widget constructor. `overrides` supposed to be an object having range of fields. Each field name is a name of overridden property and the field value is the desired value for those property. Example:

```javascript
overrides: {
    "symbolWatermarkProperties.color": "rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"

#### indicators_file_name
Path to file containing your compiled indicators. See more details [[here|Creating-Custom-Studies]].

#### preset
`preset` is a name of a set of pre-defined widget settings. All settings used by preset also may be used directly by you in widget's constructor. For now, the only `mobile` preset is supported. The example of this preset is available online.

#### studies_overrides
Use this option to customize default indicators' style or inputs. You can also customize `Compare` series' styles and inputs using this argument. See more details [[here|Studies-Overrides]]

#### time_frames

```
Time frame is an object containing `text` and `resolution` property. Text must have following format: `<integer><y|m|d>` ( \d+(y|m|d) as Regex ). Resolution is a string having the common resolutions format. See [[this topic|Time-Frames]] to learn more about time frames.
The `description` property was added in 1.7 and it is displayed in the popup menu. This parameter is optional (if the time frame descriptor does not contain this property: `title` (if it is specified) or `text` is used).
The `title` property was added in 1.9 and this value will override default title generated from `text` property. This parameter is optional.
