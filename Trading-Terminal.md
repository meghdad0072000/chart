:chart: All content on this page is relevant for Trading Terminal only.

Trading Terminal is a ready-to-use product for those who want to have a great charting solution along with the ability to trade right from the chart. This product is based on Charting Library and includes all its functionality, but also contains a bunch of new features. Trading Terminal repo is [[here|https://github.com/tradingview/trading_platform]].

The product is under development so some features are not there yet. They are marked with :clock4:.

## Trading Terminal Features

You can trade right from the chart, and all you have to do to make this work is to implement your [[Broker API]] and plug it into the chart widget.

#### Japanese charts types: Kagi, Renko, Point & Figure, Line Break
These types of charts will be available out-of-the-box, just like Heikin Ashi is available in Charting Library.

#### Volume Profile :clock4:
This study will require some server-side support. We'll provide more detals when it's ready.

#### Drawing Tools Templates :clock4:
This functionality will require the support from your backend. We'll update our open-source data backend to support this feature also, so consider using it to minimize the efforts from your side.
