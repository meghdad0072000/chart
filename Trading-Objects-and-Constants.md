## Broker Configuration

#### configFlags: object

This is an object that should be passed in the constuctor of the Trading Terminal to [[brokerConfig|Widget-Constructor#brokerConfig]]. Each field should have a boolean value (`true`/`false`):

* supportReversePosition

    Broker supports reverse of a position.
    If it is not supported by broker, Chart will have the reverse button, but it will place a reverse order.

* supportClosePosition

    Broker supports close of a position.
    If it is not supported by broker, Chart will have the close button, but it will place a close order.

* supportReducePosition

    Broker supports changing of a position without orders.

* supportPLUpdate

    Broker provides PL for a position. If the broker calculates profit/loss by itself it should call [[plUpdate|Trading-Host#plupdatepositionid-pl]] as soon as PL is changed. Otherwise Chart will calculate PL as a difference between current trade and an average price of the position.

* supportOrderBrackets

    Broker supports brackets (take profit and stop loss) for orders. If this flag is `true` the Chart will display additional fields in the order ticket and Modify button on a chart and in the Account Manager.

* supportPositionBrackets

    Broker supports brackets (take profit and stop loss orders) for positions. If this flag is `true` the Chart will display an Edit button for positions and add `Edit position...` to the context menu of a position.

* supportTradeBrackets

    Broker supports brackets for single trades (take profit and stop loss orders). If this flag is `true` the Chart will display an Edit button for trades (individual positions) and add `Edit position...` to the context menu of a trade.

* supportTrades

    Broker supports individual positions (trades). If it is set to `true`, there will be two tabs in the Account Manager - Individual Positions and Net Positions.

* requiresFIFOCloseTrades

    Trading account requires closing of trades in FIFO order.

* supportCloseTrade

    Individual positions (trades) can be closed.

* supportMultiposition

    Supporting multiposition prevents creating default implementation for reverse position.

* showQuantityInsteadOfAmount

	This flag can be used to change "Amount" to "Quantity" in the order dialog

* supportLevel2Data

    Level2 data is used for DOM widget. `subscribeDepth` and `unsubscribeDepth` should be implemented.

* supportStopLimitOrders

    This flag adds stop-limit orders type to the order dialog.
    
* supportMarketBrackets
	Using this flag you can disable brackets for market orders. By default it is enabled.

* supportModifyDuration
    Using this flag you can enable modification of the duration of the existing order. By default it is disabled.

#### durations: array of objects
List of expiration options of orders. It is optional. Do not set it if you don't want the durations to be displayed in the order ticket.
The objects have two kes: `{ name, value }`.

Example:

```
durations: [{ name: 'DAY', value: 'DAY' }, { name: 'GTC', value: 'GTC' }]
```

#### customNotificationFields: array of strings
Optional field. You can use it if you have custom fields in orders or positions that should be taken into account when showing notifications.

For example, if you have field `additionalType` in orders and you want the chart to show a notification when it is changed, you should set:

```
customNotificationFields: ['additionalType']
```
