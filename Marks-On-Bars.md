Charting Library supports showing marks on bars. Here is an example:

Each mark can have a color, size, label and a pop-up message. Marks are requested from your back-end if it declared to support them. Marks are designed to give you an ability to show a number of events attached to bars. Here are a few examples:

* News
* Some very special bars configurations
* Splits/Dividends
* .. and so on.
